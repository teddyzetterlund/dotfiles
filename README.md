# Can't live without them dotfiles

This is where I keep all my various dotfile configuration files for backup, restore
and sync. I try to comment my files for myself and other curious people.

Feel free to do whatever you like with what you find in this project and if you have
any question, create an issue here on GitHub or [talk to me on Twitter][tw].
